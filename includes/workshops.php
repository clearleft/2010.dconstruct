            <p>Visual design is not magic, or the result of some God-given talent, but the result of applying rules, techniques and practice.</p>
            <p>Mark&#8217;s workshop will cover the basics of visual design. From collaborative idea generation and visualising ideas, to the fundamentals of typography, grid design, composition and colour theory. Good visual design is like good jazz; it&#8217;s about having the chops to improvise around the constraints. That&#8217;s what this workshop will do: it will give you the chops. All you will need to do afterwards, is practice.</p>

            <p>In the face of global recession it is our creativity that gives us the edge. Yet finding the space to be creative is harder than ever. Modern working practices mean we juggle diverse work loads whilst fielding increasing interruptions from email, tweets, text, phone, letters and colleagues.</p>
            <p>Steven and Curtis will run a practical workshop that will help you improve your productivity, and increase your capacity for creative thinking and doing.</p>
            <p>They&#8217;ll walk you through a brilliantly simple and straight forward framework designed to be habit forming: fading into the background of your work and freeing your brain to focus on what really makes a difference. It&#8217;s an intense day but you&#8217;ll enjoy the benefits immediately: feeling in control and on top of your work.</p>
            <p>You will actively review your current activities giving consideration to every task and project before constructing your own productivity system. The review will allow you to reconsider what, how and why you are doing what you are and to effectively plan and prioritise all your work going forward.</p>
            <p>The ability to access your email to do lists and calendar (e.g. via a laptop) during the workshop is useful and helps with immediate application of the learning.</p>
